# Hi, I’m Srihaas 👋
Master’s student in Electrical & Computer Engineering (specialising in Systems and Controls) at Rutgers University.  
I build autonomy systems that combine controls + perception + learning.

## 🔭 What I’m working on
- **VTOL Drone for Railway Inspection** (Pixhawk + Raspberry Pi): CV pipeline to detect overgrown grass and report GPS coordinates
- **Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Reactive Collision Avoidance**: learning reward functions from expert demonstrations with uncertainty-aware models

## 🧠 Core Skills
**Controls:** LQR/LQG, observers, MPC basics, Kalman filtering, robust control (H∞), nonlinear control (SMC)  
**Robotics:** UAV systems, sensor fusion, simulation-to-real mindset  
**ML/CV:** CNNs, model-based RL exposure (DreamerV2), data pipelines  
**Programming:** Python, C/C++, MATLAB/Simulink, Git, Linux

## 🧩 Featured Projects
### 🚁 VTOL Drone – Railway Vegetation Detection
